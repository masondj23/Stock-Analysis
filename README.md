# Stock-Analysis
## Overview of the Project
The purpose of the stock analysis project was to refactor Steve's code in order to decrease the time it takes to loop through all of the stock data.
## Results
With our refactored code, we were able to run the loop in ~.10 seconds and ~.09 seconds for 2017 and 2018, respectively. This is a huge improvement when we copmpare it to our original code which took ~.52 seconds and ~.51 seconds.
## Summary
### What are the advantages or disadvantages of refactoring code?
#### Advantages
1.) Improves function of code
2.) Improves speed of code
3.) Assists in finding bugs
#### Disadvantages
1.) Takes more time and resources for the project to be completed
### How do these pros and cons apply to refactoring the original VBA script?
When refactoring the original VBA script we were able to increase our loop speed 5X while condensing our language so that programmers and Steve can better understand the purpose of each line of code. However, we already had working code and essentially had to follow the same protocol twice which of course, takes twice as long.
